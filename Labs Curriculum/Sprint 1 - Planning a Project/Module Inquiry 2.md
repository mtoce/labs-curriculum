# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today?

    - I decided to use an API (Bureau of Labor Statistics) that has much more data, but is harder to get the specific cities we want due to the confusing nature of their site and      API.
    - I decided to avoid APIs that have a low maximum for querying (free versions) because we will have to query a lot given how many cities we plan on using.
    - I decided to utilize Worls Weather organization for weather data, since it allows for many more queries than other APIs I have found
    
2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
    
    I'm happy with choosing the department of labor API because it has so much data. I decided to use it because the max queries is fairly high and the amount of data is absurd. I chose it over other APIs like Indeed that didn't have the proper documentation and was hard to understand what queries I was able to make. The downsides to choosing it is that there is so much data, I will need to get very comfortable with navigating through the site and finding series IDs to query.
    I'm also happy with choosing the World Weather Organization as our primary API for weather data because it allows so many queries and it is very fast at collecting data. I reached out for help on possible sources because I was running into paywalls and another student recommended this API and I could not be more satisfied.
    
3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.

I made the choice I did because I think that in the long run, becoming comfortable with how the department of labor's data is laid out is going to be an advantage because there is so much data we will be able to get everything we need. Also, the max queries being greater than other sites is a huge plus given we are going to have many cities on our site.

4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process: 
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
    
    What makes a good technical choice is knowing multiple options or routes you are able to go. Once you have an understanding of your options, it just takes thought and consideration as to what you want to prioritize. For me, I wanted to make sure I would have the data I need and I would be able to access it in the given number of queries. This was the deciding factor for me and so far it has proven a good decision, but only time will tell.
