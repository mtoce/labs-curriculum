# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

    - What cities should we use for our data?
    - What hasn't worked in labs groups in the past?
 
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

    - As a user, I can view the job market/outlook for the city
    - As a user, I can see typical weather patterns for the city
    - As a user, I can view the historical housing prices /rent of a city.
    - As a user, I can search for a city by name
    - As a user, i can view historical population for a city
    - As a user, I can search a city by characteristics
    
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    
    My favorite user story is seeing job market / outlook for a city since that is highly relevant in our lives right now. The tasks needed to accomplish this tasks are:
    - Collect salary data (DS)
    - Bake into main API with weather/rent (JSON)
    - Graphical components
    - Display prominently median salary and top industry
    - Pie chart (donut chart) of top industries
    
    In this task breakdown process we correctly identified the steps needed. We could have been more specific when it came to the graphical components, but since we don't have a design layout yet we will update that as we move along. Some challenges were knowing what stepos to put since we haven't gotten to them yet. And also making design decisions this early was a challenge.
    
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

I would approach it similarly, but assign labels and namecards to each task from day 1 so we have a good idea of what we need to accomplish for our own tasks personally.
