# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

    We worked on data gathering and cleaning together.
  
2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

    I was the driver when I was the one gathering and cleaning data for weather since that's my feature. I was the navigator when we collected and cleaned 
housing data since that's Rourke's feature. I prefer navigating because I enjoy leading and I can assist by googling for specific syntax and whatnot while my teammate codes.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?

    Being the navigator can be difficult when you don't have a good grap of the data or the methods that your driver is implementing.

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

    In the future, I will adjust my pair programming behavior by doing it more often.
